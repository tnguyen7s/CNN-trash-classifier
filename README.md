# CNN-trash-classifier
This is a Deep Learning project for my CS independent study class. My objective is to learn about CNN, collect a trash dataset, and train a classifier using the trash dataset.

## Work and Result
You can see my work and result via [the powerpoint](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ftnguyen7s%2FCNN-trash-classifier%2Fmaster%2Fpp%2FTuyen_SEMO_SCR_April2023.pptx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) and [the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR1xvcsD9Z0FfbZeqbkEvP4cCLvanzNvhNufs4vjmsESTu52VwVgCIjYb2g&v=alJAc6tS6-w&feature=youtu.be) that I prepared for my presentation at Southeast Missouri State University - Student Research Conference, April 2023.

## A trash classifier webapp
Wanna try with the trash classifier that I created :))

If so, please visit https://trash-classifier-webapp.herokuapp.com/ 

## Future Work
1. Improve the modelâ€™s capability by:
*Collect more data (I encourage you to support these two projects: https://openlittermap.com/about and http://tacodataset.org/ by uploading your trash images)
*Deal with complexity of trash sorting: different kinds of glass can be recycled, but others are not; the same to plastics. Research to answer the question whether computer vision can deal with this complexity.

2. Create a low cost and effective machine/robot that can effectively scan through the trash and do the sorting for us by either grasping the trash and placing it to the correct bin or moving it to the correct bin in a belt conveyor 

3. Monitor training process in future work; using best practices to reduce training time and carbon footprint produced by the work.
